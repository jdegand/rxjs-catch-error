# Rxjs Catch Error

Solution to [Devesh Chaudhari's RxJs Catch Error Angular Challenge Proposal](https://github.com/tomalaforge/angular-challenges/pull/193)

## Built With

- [Angular](https://angular.io)
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5.

## Thoughts

- Good setup to the challenge
- Little easy but still important topic 
- Adding test requirement could make harder
- Have to click the button for submission to happen on the input - enter doesn't work
- Using button refs -> reason for poor accessibility ?
- Didn't use tailwind for the styling - could be converted - I'm not a big tailwind user
- Better to cap the width of returned json from the api request to improve styling
